5.1.1.1.1 Purpose
This test simulates the exposure of the DUT to low temperatures without electrical operation, e.g. during
shipment of the system/component. Failure mode is insufficient frost resistance, e.g. the freezing of liquid
crystal displays.
5.1.1.1.2 Test method
Perform the test in accordance with IEC 60068-2-1, Test A, at a temperature of −40 °C for a duration of 24 h
unless otherwise specified in the DUT specification. The operating mode of the DUT is 1.1, as defined in
ISO 16750-1
